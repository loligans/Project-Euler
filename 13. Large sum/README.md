## Thoughts and Potential Solutions
So when I first saw this problem I thought 50-digit numbers can fit into a `long` right? Well that's just not true. A `long` can only fit _about_ 19-digits in base-10 notation. That clearly will not work for this solution.

### The first obstacle
So the `long` data type is just not gonna cut it here, we need to find an appropriate data structure to hold our excessively large whole number. So what are our options?

 - `Strings` - When I first saw this problem I thought "oh you could simply do the work with strings." While that may be true, it made me feel icky because there are certainly more ways to solve this problem.
 - `BigInt` - So a lot of languages and frameworks have built in methods for handling enormous numbers. These data structures are usually battle tested and have stood the test of time. This is a closer step in the right direction.
 - `Custom` - What I mean is our own data structure that can handle excessively large whole numbers. It should be able to hook interact with existing primitive data types seamlessly.

#### So what are some tradeoffs with the above options?
- Starting with `Strings`, I think using `Strings` is the easiest option for people to wrap their mind around conceptually. It could be good for prototyping the concept quickly and then retroactively modifying to something else down-the-line, _assuming `BigInt` was not available_. I'm thinking low upfront effort and more work down the line. In terms of performance, my intuition is that it would be slower than the `BigInt` and `Custom` data types.
- If choosing to use `BigInt` I think this problem could be solved pretty quickly and effortlessly. It's a great example of not reinventing the wheel. This is likely the ideal option if you're prototyping some great feature that requires huge numbers. Depending on the language and/or framework being used the performance of this type could be good enough for the majority of situations.
- Why on Earth would we want to reinvent the wheel with our own custom data structure? Well, because it's fun! Since we are in control of the data and how it interacts with other data types and structures, we can add some really cool optimizations. The downside is that the amount of upfront work required is likely going to be much higher than previous methods.

### The second obstacle (When does it end?)
Okay so we decided to write our own fancy custom data structure to handle these god forsaken enormous whole numbers. We have a couple of interactions we need to think about. Since the problem only requires us to _add whole numbers_, our data structure will be pretty slim (it's not gonna worry about division, multiplication, and subtraction).

#### Anticipated interactions
_Mom look at me I'm planning my implementations!_ ðŸ¤­
- Let's call the data structure the unimaginative name: Int256
- When creating an Int256 what types should our constructor take? I'm thinking for now let's pass a `ReadOnlyMemory<byte>`. We should set up tests around construction to ensure invalid data that may be passed into the data structure is prevented.
- When `adding` we should override the `+` operator for the `Int256` type. We could expand upon this down the line if we need too, to include other data types and structures. Testing should cover positive Int256, negative Int256, and overflows.
- When viewing the raw data, we should expose a `ReadOnlyMemory<byte>` of the data structure. In testing we should ensure this data represents the actual value of the data structure.
- We should also override ToString to expose the string representation of the data structure. Like above, the string representation should reflect the actual value of the data structure.

## The aftermath (pun unintended)
Hello again fellow reader. So I've come back to share with you the results of the above work I mentioned.

- So I greatly simplified the work of creating an `Int256` by using the `BigInt` struct in the language of choice. By creating a parsing function that takes a string and creates a `BigInt` which then further gets converted to an `Int256`, I was able to focus on the actual work at hand. This takes a dependency on `BigInt` and might not be optimal in some cases. This obviously is not what I had planned above, but it shows how sometimes during a project tradeoffs need to be made that weren't originally documented. Perhaps further down the line in a future Project Euler problem I will need to expand upon this data structure and implement a parsing algorithm that more efficient.
- There were a number of operations that needed to be implemented. In order to make this data structure fully functioning to perform basic summations I needed to add bit shifting, addition, subtraction, and a number of cast operators. This was more work than I originally anticipated (_I expected just having to worry about the addition operation_) but these additional operations are a necessity in order to have a fast and efficient data structure that holds 256-bit integers.
- So viewing the raw data as a `ReadOnlyMemory<byte>` still isn't a bad idea, but it quickly became out-of-scope for this project. Instead I opted to use `BigInt` again to convert the huge number into a `String`.

## Summary and References
Overall this was a great learning experience for me. I was able to speed a lot of this work up with the help of other very intelligent individuals who have done a similar things. The design for this data structure is not my own, I borrowed heavily from [ricksladkey/dirichlet-numerics](https://github.com/ricksladkey/dirichlet-numerics). How I learn is, when learning something new, I never copy code. I instead type it out. This forces me to think about all of the authors decisions.
